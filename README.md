# Predict_ML

A machine‑learning project that builds, trains, and evaluates predictive models using data to forecast outcomes.

## Features

- Load and preprocess datasets (CSV, Excel, etc)  
- Train machine learning models with scikit‑learn  
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC)  
- Save/serialize trained models (with `joblib` or `pickle`)  
- (Optional) Use deep learning models with TensorFlow / Keras  
- Visualize results using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrbadbug/Predict_ML.git
   cd Predict_ML
